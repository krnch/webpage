I had applied to the SPIKE fellow program [Spike](http://engineering.nyu.edu/business/future-labs/fellowships) and got into Project Economics as an intern . 

Company background - Project Economics [PE](http://www.projecteconomics.net/) is a software company providing community solar solutions with the help of their Open Energy Platform Software . 
Their technology Stack - [platform](http://www.projecteconomics.net/platform.html)
Their Major Services- [service](http://www.projecteconomics.net/services.html)

Here's a list of activities / tasks I completed as a part of my internship .

* Added customer support features for notes and tickets to  the existing software written in Java Spring Framework.

* Created a new dashboard showing aggregated data for User Details related to ticksets issued .

* Ported the created features across all different modules of the platform .

* Resolved existing bugs in the software .

Overall my experience at Project Economics was interesting and I got to learn a lot about Writing and Maintaining Quality Code for larger codebases
